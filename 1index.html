    <div class="explanation"><p>We all store a lot of personal data on social networks - and if you <br> use the defalit settings, literally everyone can see a significant <br> portion of this data. Therefore, check the privacy settings for all <br> social networks you use. What should be shown to everyone <br> and what can only be seen by your friends (or no one but you) <br> is up to you, not Mark Zuckerberg.
</p></div>
    <section class="help_stuff"><div class="li_one"><li>Change your social media privacy settings. <br> Instagram Facebook, Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki, <br> Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram are all ways to do this.</li></div>
    <div  class="li_tow"><li>From time to time, social networks change attitudes. <br> So sometimes check if something new has appeared. <br> For example, recently, Vkontakte has introduced a ban <br> on the search under your profile by phone number - <br> a useful option that we recommend.</li></div>
